# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The most effecient way of ensuring an indivuals code, program, or software is both functional and secure is the use of testing. Testing enables developers to verfiy their source code produces correct outputs and takes valid inputs. This activly produces more efficent and fuctional software due to the conditional testing that esnures a program behaves in the desired manner before it is deployed in live enviorments. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interprerate users needs as system requirments. These requirments strcute the design in both function and testing. This interpretation enables source code to be designed with the given requirment in mind while also enabling acurate tests to be generated using the requirments as the tests design parameters. In short, the users define the project and we, the developers, design and test our project utilizing the users needs as benchmarks for said design. 

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first determining the goal of the project. What is it that I, as a developer is trying to accomplish? This helps clerify what features and structures will need to be utilized in order to achieve this goal. In establishing what the project requirments are it focuses analysis and design on the crucial elements. This produces code that is efficent, functional, and timely.
